# Support for Arm Cortex-R (AArch32) and Arm Cortex-A (AArch32)

This crate provides access to CPU registers and common peripherals for:

* Armv7-R Processors, like the Arm Cortex-R5
* Armv8-R AArch32 Processors, like the Arm Cortex-R52
* Armv7-A Processors, like the Arm Cortex-A5
* Armv8-A AArch32 Processors, like the Arm Cortex-A53 running in 32-bit mode

It does not support processors running in AArch64 mode - A64 machine code uses
different instructions for reading/writing system registers.

This crate contains:

* Raw register access to many Armv7-R and Armv8-R AArch32 system registers
* A driver for the PMSAv7 Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
* A driver for the PMSAv8-R Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
* A driver for the Arm Generic Timer

If you need a driver for the Arm Generic Interrupt Controller, see
<https://github.com/google/arm-gic>.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.83.0 and up, as recorded
by the `package.rust-version` property in `Cargo.toml`.

Increasing the MSRV is not considered a breaking change and may occur in a
minor version release (e.g. from `0.3.0` to `0.3.1`, because this is still a
`0.x` release).
